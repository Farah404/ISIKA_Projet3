					<h2>Obstacles to working with your offshore dedicated

							<p>Having a dedicated development team can be a game-changer
								for any eCommerce company, big or small. After all, offshore has
								continuously proved itself a superior technology outsourcing
								solution during the past few years. If you are unfamiliar with
								the terms, don’t worry. Click on our article to dip your first
								toe into this spectacular area of the industry. With all the
								love and the hype, it’s obvious how beneficial having an
								offshore development team by your side is. Time-saving and
								cost-efficient are only two among several ways offshore can help
								your business grow speedily. However, just like any other
								method, it can be quite challenging to work with your offshore
								partners. That is why we’re here today: to offer you 6 perfect
								supportive tools to help you with all offshore-related problems.
								Without further ado, let’s get into them!</p>

								<h2>Performance control</h2>
								<br />
								<p>Whatever happens during a project doesn’t matter as much
									as the results that come out of it. This is why you should
									always keep track of the outcomes in every step so you can
									control the overall quality better. The reality, however, can
									be quite challenging if you are working with an offshore
									partner. No matter how much you trust the dedicated development
									team, certain questions will still pop up during the working
									process. For example, how are you sure that the results you
									receive are real and not fabricated? How can you know that the
									time and the tasks are being organized accordingly to your
									needs instead of theirs? Are they using your money and
									resources right? If you are not a professional, these doubts
									are going to be even more severe.</p>

								<h2>Lack of communicating</h2>
								<br />
								<p>You can not accomplish anything without proper
									communication. This is why we need bonding activities and
									colleagues. But with an offshore team so far away – sometimes
									an ocean from you, even – communicating is no easy task. Most
									of the time you’ll only hand out tasks and receives finished
									work back via supportive tools, as well as use online platforms
									to talk and update each other on how everything’s progressing.
									These are all highly helpful, but is it enough? The answer,
									unfortunately, can be a resounding “no” if you are not careful.</p>

								<h2>Differences</h2>
								<br />
								<p>It can be incredibly tough to maintain quick and
									effective communication with such difficulties. Say, if you
									have an emergency problem that needs to be addressed, waiting
									several hours to several days to get feedback from your
									offshore partner will be infuriating. Another huge obstacle is
									the cultural gap – which can lead to miscommunication,
									conflicts, and frustration beyond your expectations. Imagine
									receiving some poor coding and having no way to fix it
									immediately. Annoying, right? This is, sadly, an entire
									possibility with offshore outsourcing. There can be many
									situations that can lead to this, but it all comes down to the
									distance – mentally and physically – between the parties
									involved. Without a doubt, low-quality results might be
									devastating to any project – requiring debugging efforts,
									wasting resources, and causing a hostile working atmosphere.</p>
