							<h2>Everyone is talking about chatbots. But how do you
								actually add one to your website?</h2>
							<br />
							<p>First off, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to
								finding the perfect chatbot for your website. But don’t worry,
								it isn’t rocket science. Here are your options, use cases and
								examples.</p>
							<br /> <img width="100%" src="media/gif/coding/Header_gif_assembly-1.gif" /> <br />

								<h2>ONE: Build a chatbot inside of your website chat
									software</h2>
								<br />
								<p>Through a survey about chatbot perceptions, we learned
									that customers greatly prefer an easy escalation route when
									speaking to a chatbot. The speediness that chatbots can offer
									is nice, but there are few things more frustrating than being
									stuck in a loop with a chatbot that cannot get you what you
									want. Coupling your bot with your live chat software allows it
									to forward inquiries to an available agent when the customer
									has an issue it can’t resolve. It also makes it easier for your
									team to monitor its performance and make adjustments where
									necessary. In our live chat solution Userlike, for instance,
									you can build your own chatbot with the Userlike Bot Language.
									With it, you can write bot scripts with simple, minimal syntax
									to assist customers through your website widget. There are a
									variety of ways to use a custom chatbot on your website. To not
									get bogged down in possibilities, Userlike helps you out with
									four clear routing modes to choose from:</p>
								<br />
								<ul>
									<li>Human. The chatbot operates like any other human
										service agent. There is no special preference if a human or
										the bot answers the inquiry.</li>
									<li>Failover. The chatbot only jumps in if all other
										operators have their chat slots occupied.</li>
									<li>Quality: homogenizing the code increases overall
										quality, especially with a team of developers with different
										levels of experience.</li>
									<li>Firewall. The chatbot always answers the chat inquiry
										first. You can set your logic to trigger at which point to
										forward the chat to a living agent – for example when the
										chatbot is unable to answer the question.</li>
									<li>Service Time. This one is active outside of service
										time. The chatbot answers all inquiries. By your determined
										logic, it can create a ticket for its human colleagues when a
										user needs help with something the chatbot can’t assist with.
									</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>TWO: Use an out-of-the-box chatbot</h2>
								<br />
								<p>The quickest and simplest way to add a chatbot to your
									website is to create a chatbot using a platform like Botsy or
									PandoraBots. These ready-made solutions help you provide 24/7
									chatbot service without the need for a developer. A pre-made
									chatbot can take care of simple tasks like answering frequently
									asked questions, scheduling appointments or welcoming a visitor
									to your website. Just know that these chatbots often follow a
									rigid decision tree structure when interacting with a user,
									leaving little to no room for improving its AI. On the upside,
									some platforms offer a chatbot that has the potential to grow
									its IQ if you add certain plugins like Google search, Bing
									search or RSS Import. On the downside, many pre-made chatbots
									are not equipped with a live chat option that allows it to
									forward the conversation to a human chat agent when it runs out
									of answers. Some chatbot platforms, like Landbot.io, offer
									plugins that allow a chatbot to create a ticket and send it to
									your customer relationship management system. This lets your
									agents take on the difficult requests the chatbot wasn’t able
									to help with. How you implement the chatbot on your website
									depends on the platform you choose and your website’s
									framework. You might have to download a plug-in, like for
									Wordpress, or you can paste the chatbot's code into your
									website's backend.</p>
								<br />

								<h2>THREE: Implement a chatbot using a chat provider’s API
								</h2>
								<br />
								<p>The above two options for adding a chatbot for your
									website are still rather basic. They are easy to implement and
									they are fine if you’re looking for simplicity. For a more
									sophisticated chatbot setup, however, the best way is to
									connect your website chat solution with a specialized, advanced
									AI solution like IBM Watson. When faced with a customer
									question, such an advanced chatbot would be able to run through
									the complete database of previous customer questions and
									answers given by human support reps. Then it could make a
									judgment of what is the best answer based on customer ratings
									and sentiment analysis, pick that answer and send it. And based
									on the customer's reply, it would be able to learn whether that
									answer was helpful or not–helping it do better the next time a
									similar question is asked. There are no website chat solutions
									with such intelligence built in, and no AI solutions with added
									website chat functionality. For such a setup to be possible,
									your website chat solution needs a chatbot API. At Userlike,
									our customers have used our API for all kinds of cool setups.
									Once you connect your advanced chatbot to Userlike, you have
									access to all the routing modes and interaction approaches
									mentioned above plus much more.</p>
