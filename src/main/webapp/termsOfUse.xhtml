								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<br />
								<p>Our Purpose:</p>
								<br />
								<ul>
									<li>Our services offer our users the ability to easily
										create beautiful and highly functional online presence, to
										manage and promote businesses, content and ideas, and have an
										overall great experience doing so – without being tech-savvy
										or a design guru. As detailed below, we offer our users
										numerous tools and features for creating, publishing and use
										of stunning websites, online e-commerce platforms,
										newsletters, galleries, media players, mobile apps and other
										online and mobile online and mobile applications, tools and
										services. The online and mobile websites and platforms created
										by Users are collectively referred to herein as (“User
										Platform(s)”).</li>
								</ul>
								<br />
								<p>User Account:</p>
								<br />
								<ul>
									<li>In order to access and use certain sections and
										features of the Smariter Services, you must first register and
										create an account with Smariter (“User Account”). <br />If
										anyone other than yourself accesses your User Account and/or
										any of your User Platforms’ settings, they may perform any
										actions available to you (unless as specifically stated
										otherwise on the Smariter Services), make changes to your User
										Platform(s) and User Account, and accept any legal terms
										available therein, make various representations and warranties
										and more – and all such activities will be deemed to have
										occurred on your behalf and in your name. <br /> Therefore,
										we strongly encourage you to keep the log-in credentials of
										your User Account confidential, and allow such access only to
										people you trust - as you will be solely and fully responsible
										for all activities that occur under your User Account and/or
										User Platforms (including for any representations, warranties
										and undertakings made therein), whether or not specifically
										authorized by you, and for any damages, expenses or losses
										that may result from such activities. <br /> You must provide
										accurate and complete information when registering your User
										Account and using the Smariter Services, to which you are the
										sole and exclusive rights holder. We strongly encourage you to
										provide your own (or your company’s) contact and billing
										details, including your valid e-mail address, as we may use it
										to identify and determine the actual and true owner of the
										User Account and/or User Content (as defined below) submitted
										to us.

									<li>use any “robot”, “spider” or other automatic device,
										program, script, algorithm, or methodology, or any similar or
										equivalent manual process, to access, acquire, copy, or

								<h2>Service Fees</h2>
								<br />
								<p>Paid Services:</p>
								<br />
								<ul>

									<li>The use of certain Smariter Services may be subject to
										payment of particular fees, as determined by Smariter in its
										sole discretion (“Paid Services” and “Fee(s)”, respectively).
										Smariter will provide notice of such Fees then in effect in
										relation to such Paid Services. If you wish to receive or use
										such Paid Services, you are required to pay all applicable
										Fees in advance.</li>
									<li>Smariter reserves the right to change its Fees at any
										time, upon notice to you if such change may affect your
										existing subscriptions. If you received a discount or other
										promotional offer, Smariter shall have the right to
										automatically and without notice renew your subscription to
										such Smariter Service(s) at the full applicable Fee.</li>
									<li>Code quality: The code produced by the generator
										should be very efficient at execution and it is also better
										when it is developer-readable—though sometimes not strictly
										necessary in fully-abstracted areas—but it is not required to
										be identical to human-written code.</li>
								</ul>
								<br />
								<br />
								<p>Invoices:</p>
								<br />
								<ul>

									<li>Smariter and/or its affiliated companies will issue an
										invoice or credit memo for any payment of Fees or refund made
										to or by Smariter (“Invoice”). Each Invoice will be issued in
										electronic form and based on the country stated in your
										billing address, and will be made available to you via your
										User Account and/or by e-mail. For the purpose of issuing the
										Invoice, you may be required to furnish certain Personal
										Information (as such term is defined in the Privacy Policy) in
										order to comply with local laws. Please note that the Invoice
										presented in your User Account may be inadequate with your
										local law requirements, and in such case may be used for pro
										forma purposes only.</li>
								</ul>


							</div>

								<h2>Cancellation</h2>
								<br />
								<p>Cancellation by User:</p>
								<br />
								<ul>
									<li>You may discontinue to use and request to cancel your
										User Account and/or any Smariter Services at any time, in
										accordance with the instructions available on the Smariter
										Services. The effective date and time for such cancellation
										shall be the date and time on which you have completed the
										cancellation process on the Smariter Services, and the
										effective date for cancellation of Paid Services shall be at
										the end of such Paid Services’ subscription period.</li>
									<li>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
										foregoing, with respect to subscriptions to Renewing Paid
										Services, such subscription will be discontinued only upon the
										expiration of the respective period for which you have already
										made payment. Please note that as the cancellation process may
										take a few days, in order to avoid the next automatic renewal
										and respective charge the cancellation request should be made
										at least fourteen (14) days prior to the expiration of the
										then-current service period.</li>
								</ul>
								<br />
								<p>Cancellation by Smariter:</p>
								<br />
								<ul>
									<li>Failure to comply with any of the Smariter Terms
										and/or to pay any due Fee shall entitle Smariter to suspend
										(until full payment is made) or cancel your User Account and
										User Platform (or certain features thereof), as well as the
										provision of any related Smariter Services (e.g., Paid
										Services) or Third Party Services to you.</li>

								</ul>
								<br />

								<p>Loss of Data, Content and Capacity:</p>
								<br />
								<ul>
									<li>If your User Account or any Smariter Services or Third
										Party Services related to your User Account are cancelled
										(whether at your request or at Smariter’s discretion), it may
										cause or result in the loss of certain content, features, or
										capacity of your User Account, including any User Content, End
										User data or other usage data retained therein, and including
										any domain name reservation or registration that was included
										in such Services (“Capacity Loss”). Smariter shall not be
										liable in any way for such Capacity Loss, or for saving a
										backup of your User Account, User Content or End User data.
										Please also note that additional Fees may apply to
										re-activation of a User Account and/or any Smariter Services
										following their cancellation, as determined by Smariter in its
										sole discretion.</li>
