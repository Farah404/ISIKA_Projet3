								<h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
								<br />
								<p>In the coming days, it is presumable that the role of
									artificial intelligence will become wider than ever in the
									world of websites. It can not be denied that AI will be the
									future of web development as this phase has developed at a
									higher speed. Currently, many leading companies have launched
									AI-specific. In addition, Gird is one of the most sought-after
									AI implementations that permits content-specific website
									development in no time. Furthermore, the launch of ADI tools
									has allowed automated website development which can be
									customized further according to the web developers. Two common
									examples of AI systems are Apple’s Siri and Google’s Alexa have
									features of recognizing human speech, analyzing it by tracking
									patterns, and offering a better user experience thanks to
									information interpreted. One another example of the
									fastest-growing AI trends is speech recognition. It plays an
									essential role and an indispensable part in revolutionizing the
									mobile and website development world. Gradually, big names such

								<h2>Internet of Things (IoT)</h2>
								<br />
								<p>As a survey by Statista, there will be several around 32
									billion connected devices in 2021. The huge growth in the
									number of IoT devices will positively impact the web
									development process because companies tend to manage these
									devices via laptop or desktop. In addition, the integration of
									devices with the website also plays an important role in
									bringing better services to customers. For example, IoT can be
									used to analyze fitness bands or smartwatches. They can track
									all activities of the users like tracking sleep, nutrition, and
									optimize the health goals by storing the information over the
									cloud. While only a few websites have an IoT integration
									currently, the concept will continue to focus on the near
									future as the number of connected devices will gradually
									increase.</p>

								<h2>Virtual Reality</h2>
								<br />
								<p>Over the past few years, virtual reality has been one of
									the most determined elements that have had a positive impact on
									the future of web development. Web developers have made full
									use of virtual reality to implement the top traits of
									technology to bring their users a stimulating environment. The
									websites equipped with virtual reality can permit the users to
									enjoy the 3D world in real-time and have engagement with it.
									Several famous organizations are looking for web developers
									with adequate skills in virtual reality that can be implemented
									in their business models. This can offer their clients to
									engage virtually with their products which can increase general
									customer satisfaction.</p>

								<h2>360 Degree Video</h2>
								<br />
								<p>One of the most sought-after skills that are found by
									almost all organizations worldwide is the ability to create a
									360-degree video. It can support the development of a website
									by offering an interactive and enhanced UI design. It brings
									the users a virtual experience of a product that is easy to
									describe and explain. If the designers have prior experience in
									virtual reality, they can have more opportunities to create 360
									Degree Video to increase customer engagement.</p>

								<h2>Code Injection Exposure</h2>
								<br />
								<p>The designing concept – Response Animation Idle Load has
									been here since 2015. However, it is expected to thrive in
									2021. This concept brings a faster load time at under 1 second
									and the better performance of the website. It mainly focuses on
									giving a satisfactory user experience. An article from Smashing
									Magazine has revealed that RAIL breaks down UX into tap,
									scroll, drag…actions and gives performance goals along with a
									structure that is necessary to give better performance. In
									summary, the concept of RAIL is really useful for web designers
									to follow the user-centric method.</p>

								<h2>Response Animation Idle Load (RAIL)</h2>
								<br />
								<p>These days, as many applications offer the users comment
									and feedback with the support of forms, there are some common
									ways to add a malware code injection. For example, if the
									applications do not prevent the user from adding a minimum
									number of characters into the login form and allow the use of
									characters, it will be easy for the attacker to add the code
									into the form for accessing all data of the server.</p>

								<h2>Single Page Applications (SPAs)</h2>
								<br />
								<p>Currently, most websites do not ask to add various web
									pages and financial content. However, it will make more sense
									to have a straightforward website. In addition, Single Page
									Applications (SPAs) will be effective for mobile screens. The
									visitors can smoothly scroll up and down and get the
									information that they want to have on a single page. You don’t
									need to have menus that maybe complicate the browser
									experience. If you have an eCommerce website, you will probably
									find that it will be beneficial to design and make loading time
									faster. SPAs have been an attractive topic since 2020.
									Currently, more companies are allowing them to balance the
									expense as well as give fast information to the visitors.
									Facebook, Gmail, and Github are popular examples of SPAs. A SPA
									can eliminate the specifications of reloading the website page
									by loading all the content via JavaScript. SPAs can work inside
									the browser and present natural behavior. Users tend to like it
									because SPAs have reduced waiting time and directly rendered
									the web pages in the browser of the users.</p>

									data storage for supporting users to store data in various
